###### This project is an **nuxtJS** version of the **schedule-all** project that I started using **nextJS**
You may be thinking why I interrupted the last version to focus on this one. 
So... This is because I didn't get React yet. Some concepts and features aren't solid in my mind. Because of that, I decided to construct the first version of schedule-all using nuxt (vueJS);
I will come back to next after finishing this one.

I'm trying to set up an way to use Ethereum smart contracts on this project. It is possible to apply it as a way to transfer custom tokens between users. I mean, I can create an task and invite someone to help me on that. Than I set an smart contract to that task to send an amount of my app custom token if my friend completed the task. I know it doesn't look much sense, but it is the best way I found to implement it on this project.
