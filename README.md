###### This project is an **nuxtJS** version of the **schedule-all** project that I started using **nextJS**
You may be thinking why I interrupted the last version to focus on this one. 
So... This is because I didn't get React yet. Some concepts and features aren't solid in my mind. Because of that, I decided to construct the first version of schedule-all using nuxt (vueJS);
I will come back to next after finishing this one.
